I usually thought that everyone had a special person made for them  
The Eve to their Adam  
The matching puzzle piece that completes them  
The ying to their yang  
  
I thought life was all about finding that soul mate  
There are billions of humans on this planet  
The thought of finding my soul mate felt like looking for a needle in a haystack  
I became very discouraged  
  
When it comes to love people say you just know when you found the one  
Some signal goes off in your heart when you true love is detected  
Well my soul mate radar must be on the fitz  
Many times I thought I found true love, and many times they wanted nothing to do   with me romantically
  
What is the ideal partner?  
Is it someone who you have a lot in common with  
Is it someone who is your polar opposite  
There doesn't seem to be a common census here  
  
I've been looking for love like water in the dessert  
My heart longs for it and this barren land  
That's when it came to me  
I've had blind folds over my eyes this entire time  
  
My soul mate isn't some manufactured person waiting for me at the end of my search  
They are my partner in life, they weren't created to meet my needs  
But through their love they have come to want to help me  
To help me see things in my blind spots  
They are the person who I am willing to fight for  
I'm willing to work things out with  
Willing to lay down my life for  
My heart alone didn't teach me that or show me this  
It was only when I mean you that I realize I want to make this work  
I will fight against my selfishness because I love you and want to keep loving you
