Sometimes I wonder if you think about me too,  
You always cross my mind in the quiet of the night.  
Like a nagging pain in my heart,  
The uncertainty of your love tears me apart.  

Do you think about me too?  
Does your heart ache to hear from me too?  
Does life prevent you from reaching out like a club bouncer,  
Halting your attempts to be receptive to my love?  

Do you think about me too?  
Am I just a thought in the back of your mind?  
Am I a faint thought, a distant memory,  
Another option, just a backup.  

A friend told me I’m hurting myself,  
Thinking about you thinking of me.  
Pondering the intentions of your heart,  
Is like rubbing a prickly cactus.  

I won’t think about you.  
I won’t think about you.  
I won’t think about you!  
You don’t think about me too.
