    *CHARLOTTE walks into her bedroom. Claudia is standing over the shattered pieces of CHARLOTTE's violin. In CLAUDIA's right hand is the snapped neck of Charlotte's violin. There is a guilty expression on CLAUDIA's face.*

    CHARLOTTE
    (*With tears forming in her eyes.*)
    You devil! You cold-hearted lizard! How could you do such a wicked thing to me? You conniving snake! You waited for no one to be home so that you could attack my violin! You immoral woman, how dare you damage my pride and joy! You didn't expect me to be home so early, did you? You thought you were going to be able to get away with this. I would have accused you anyways. Deep down in my heart, I've always known that you've hated me. I see the way you look at me across the dinner table. I suspected there was great bitterness in your heart. But I didn't want to believe that my own flesh and blood could be capable of such evil.
    You know how important my violin was to me. You know I had a competition coming up. One that would change my life forever. Day after day I've been practicing for this opportunity. Mother and Father have given me their full support. I thought you did too, but I guess you were lying through your teeth. You knew that the grand prize was a lump-sum of money, enough to radically change someone's life. You know how much I've wanted to move out of these slums and go to the big city. You know how much I've wanted to be free to enjoy the luxuries of life. I should have kept my dreams a secret between me and my Mother.
    You were always jealous of my dreams. We were both born in the same lowly station in life, but I always dreamed of a life much better than this. From the moment I learned to speak my mind I could sense that bitterness and envy were bubbling up in your rotten heart. You're a no-good complacent hag. Just because your life is going nowhere doesn't give you the right to try to halt mine! To think, my own flesh and blood would be my greatest opposition!
    Do you hate me because my Mother comes from fortune, and yours was poor? You know that doesn't matter because she gave all that up when she married Father, right? My mother, our mother, loves you like her own, but now that I think of it, you always looked at me and her with contempt.
    I never went to school. Mother thought she could teach me better than public school teachers. She'd boast that she was taught by the best teachers Germany had to offer. She offered the opportunity to you, but you thought it was beneath you, but now look at me. I speak better than you, I'm more musically talented than you. Heck, you have no sense of pitch when you "singing". I'm well versed in history and politics, math and sciences. I know that there is a life much better than the one I'm currently living in. I refuse to be locked in this cage called poverty forever.
    You are aware of how hard life has been for me since childhood. I had no friends besidesmy beloved violin. The neighborhood kids were always jealous of me. (In a mockingvoice) “Oh, she thinks she is better than us with her proper speech and brain the size ofan encyclopedia. She thinks she is rich, but she is dirt poor like us. She is worse than usbecause she doesn't know her place. She thinks she can cross the chasm between the richand poor, hahaha.”
    (Speaking normally) You know how much I want to spread my wings and get out of this place. You know how I have had such a hard time fitting in. You know how much I hate this place. They ridicule me for being ambitious. You know how much I've been belittled and attacked by those heathens.
    How dare you fully align yourself with those who seek to make my life miserable. You never had empathy for me. You never stood up for me when the kids bullied me. I forgave you for that. I understand peer pressure is a heck of a drug. I always had your back when Mother and Father asked why you did nothing to help me. You actually had friends and I didn't want you to get in trouble and lose them. So why, why would you be so cruel that you would destroy my only friend?

    *Looking at her broken violin.*

    CHARLOTTE CONT.
    You were my way out of this pit called poverty, and now you're dead. Your neck crushed like a gazelle's underneath the ferocious teeth of a lioness. Claudia, you heartless heathen, you crushed my joy. I hope life crushes what little remains of your pitiful dreams!
    Why did this have to be my lot in life? I am cursed with this desire to break free from my station in life. Why was I cursed with poverty? I am a caged bird. Poverty is my cage, and my violin was the key to my cage. Now I am stuck. My only means of joy and freedom is gone.
    I can't afford to replace you, my dear. My happiness will now be forever locked away on the other side of this cage. Curse you, Claudia. I am now as cold as you are. You always felt embarrassed by me. You always disowned me in public. Now, it's my turn to disown you! I renounce the blood we share. You are not my sister, you're my enemy! I despise you. You are like a bottom-feeding crab in a bucket of crabs. You are too stubborn and jealous to watch another from your station in life succeed.
    You have hurt me, and you've done it for the last time. I'm running away from home because I can't stand to be in the same building as you. Your bitter heart disgusts me. Your soul is as filthy as a pig's pen. You are dead to me. If it truly is my fate to die poor, I don't want my tomb to be near your cursed soul!

    *CHARLOTTE finishes picking up the broken pieces of her violin. She holds them in her arms like a wounded pet and leaves the scene in tears. CLAUDIA falls down to her knees and cries.*
