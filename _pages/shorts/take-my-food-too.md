My nephew sat thereon at the glass dining table. He was like an innocent chipmunk. His puffy round cheeks, moved in circular motions as he consumed his golden brown pancakes. Kofi hadn’t been eating for long. The hotcakes covered plate like a blanket on a bed, and white puffy steam gushed up the hotcakes. He saw I had been admiring him, and he wasn't pleased. Kofi was always running around the house and asking me questions about my personal life. My nephew was a happy-go-lucky kid, but that went out the window when I came.

My sister and I are inseparable. Even when she moved across the Atlantic to give my nephew a better opportunity in life, I need to join her. They've been living in the Dumfries suburban in a lovely townhouse, in a comfortable inviting neighborhood. Their house was a magnetic force that lured me closer to it. I hurried down the parking trying to find the visitor parking, there’s never enough room when you need.

"Ugh, I can’t believe it! I’m this close to seeing my sister again, but this freaky lack of parking is getting in the way!" Assaulting my leather steering wheel I bring to cry. In the corner of my eye, I watched my sister’s husband step out of the white townhouse on the absolute left of the chain of homes. They were already having dinner, he was wearing his white tank top stained with scrumptious liquids.

"Olivia! Come park in my spot, I will move my Toyota!" he yelled as he used his hands to signal me his way. He lives his front porch and hops into his modest green car. Blrrrt, the car yawns as he ignites it. Pah, moans the vehicle as it gets up from its resting spot and moves down the driveway. I park my car in the parking lot and rush into the house, suitcase flying behind me.

"Who are you ma’am?" a young adorable boy asks me. A tear ran down my cheek as his large Bambi like eyes looked at me. I swooped him up into my arms and squeezed him with my love. We haven't had a lovely moment since. I've been staying in his room, it must've been a sacred place to him. From an adorable chipmunk to an aggressive grumpy cat, my nephew acted differently around me. I somewhat felt bad for being in his mom, I knew tell he loved it. Every day I stayed he would visit to annoy me. Didn't work though, he's too cute and funny to get on my nerves.

"Auntie, why are you stealing my room?" He asked daily.

"Oh sweetheart, I'm not. I'm just borrowing it for a few days. Don't worry I won't make a mess."

I descended stair and walked into the kitchen. My sweetheart was eating breakfast with his mom sitting next to him. He noticed me and his smile quickly hide under a devious smirk.

"Hey, Auntie, why don't you take my food since you're taking my room!" He stabbed his pancake with his fork and sat up from his seat. He had an enormous grin on his face, it is as if he planned that all. My sister and I shared a laugh. I couldn't wait to tell him all this when I grew up.
