Mommy, Daddy Look! I Can Ride a Bike
By Mathew Owusu Jr   
  
Bike riding is a child's rite of passage  
Gather up all youre grown up friends, Im sure they can ride a bike  
They know what its like, feeling the wind on my skin like a kite,   
Being free and light, nimble like water as they swerve around obsticles  
  
I am an outliner  
I am full of embarrashmnet and regret  
I am chained on the ground  
Bounded by the fear of falling  
  
You see he that keeps me imprison  
He has kept me from learning to ride a bike   
Each time I try is like trying not to fall off a tight rope  
  
Doubt and Anxiety remind me again that I'm going to fail  
So give in I might as well  
My friend had empathy on me, she showed me a simpler way  
  
"If you're not ready to run, then waddle like a toddler  
Paddle your feet along the ground and try to stire  
This will help you improve your balance dear"  
  
Slowly and steady I had no more fears  
As my confidence increased I stretched myself to higher levels  
Like a child finally figuring out how to walk and run about  
The muscle memory became ingrained and the skill was now simple and plane  
After all that trial and error, it clicked it was there  
Im free now fear! I can pedal anywhere
