Second Chance

Shame and rejection where my only friends  
Humiliation was the only clothing I wore around   
Once, I slept in the same houses as princes,   princesses, and kings
Now I make my bed with the outcasts of society  
  
They don't have much because they aren't allowed to  
They have be made to be considered lesser than the   elite
They are considered to be animals and tools to them  
And I have been lumped in with them  
  
I always felt guilty when I parttaked in my siblings    mockery of the pleasants
Our victims knew I was just like them, they saw I was   an imposter
I can only imagine the hurt of being ridiculed by   someone who looks just like you,
Making for of what makes you you  
  
I've been trying to make up for my wrongs  
I've been fighting for the forgotten ones of my society  
The children of the elite love to pull pranks on lower   the lower class
They know they can get away with it since we have no   rights
  
One day I was walking through a quiet street  
When I heard her cry for help  
They upper class hoodlums had stolen her bookbag and   held her by the neck with fist ready to punch her
She recognized me when I came to her aid  
  
I was the same one who years earlier I bullied her   older sister with my siblings
She wasnâ€™t afraid of me though  
Must of heard I had been kicked out of royal family   for being just like her
Being humbled as helped made me less intimidating  
  
I stood up for her  
Ended up getting myself beat up  
But she was safe  
She forgave me for wronging her in the past  
  
She accepted me, befriended  
Clothed me in her kindness and friendship  
Invited me to live under her roof  
I am proud to make my bed with the outcasts of society
