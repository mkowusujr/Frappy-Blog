Rejection

I always felt like I didn't fit in  
This became all more clear when my brothers finally   had their way
  
My people have a rigid class system  
If you resemble the bottom of the totem you're treated   like dirt
My brothers walked all over me growing up  
The were royalty and22 I was a pleasant lucky to share   the same air they breathed
  
Father continued to shine for his love for me  
But all I felt was the cold mocks from my siblings   
  
The poked fun of my height, my frailties, and my   shortcomings 
They could move boulders by the will of their minds  
And I was lucky if I could nudge a pebble   
They had tens of wives and 100 hundreds of children  
I just had no one to call my own  
  
But father continued to shine forth his love for me  
Yet all I felt was the cold mocks from my siblings   
  
Our father was the had the highest authority amongst   our people
He was a great conqueror and a fierce lover  
He had a great love for his children  
He gave to each of them their own planet to rule when   they became of age
  
And I looked forward to the day I'd reach that age  
The day the families ugly duckling would become a swan  
But my brothers had their way  
  
I always felt I didn't fit in  
And they made that feeling a reality   
The used their influence to cause an uproar amongst   our people at the thought of me
Little ol me becoming a ruler  
  
They convinced my father's advisors that I was a   mistake and didn't belong
And when my father retired and handed over power to my   brothers
They cast out out my own home   
No longer could I feel my father's love   
Just resentment for my siblings
