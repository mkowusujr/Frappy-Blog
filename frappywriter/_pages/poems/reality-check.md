Reality Check
By Mathew Owusu Jr  
  
I am in the wilderness  
My will and happiness drying up  
A worm languishing in the hot arid sun  
My strength depleting, all alone  
  
I am on fire  
A the star in the night sky  
Radiant, glistening, sustaining men with my greatness  
I can do no wrong  
  
But like an interloper in the dark  
He has come to plunder my radiance and expose my weakness  
He has come to knock me out of the sky  
To save my from my self  
  
I was drunk on my own greatness when he came to my aid  
A loving father to remind me, I am not like them  
The stars, radiant and glistening, bright without imperfection  
Who am I but weak and dependent, a babe in need of rest
